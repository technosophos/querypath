 * Provide tools for running XSL Transformation (XSLT) on a document.
 *
 * This extension provides the {@link QPXSL::xslt()} function, which transforms
 * a source XML document into another XML document according to the rules in
 * an XSLT document.
 *
 * This QueryPath extension can be used as follows:
 * <code>
 * <?php
 * require 'QueryPath/QueryPath.php';
 * require 'QueryPath/Extension/QPXSL.php';
 *
 * qp3('src.xml')->xslt('stylesheet.xml')->writeXML();
 * ?>
 *
 * This will transform src.xml according to the XSLT rules in
 * stylesheet.xml. The results are returned as a QueryPath object, which
 * is written to XML using {@link QueryPath::writeXML()}.
 * </code>
