 * It will then be available through Query Path.
 *
 * For information on building your own extension, see {@link Extension}.
 * If you are trying to load an extension you have downloaded, chances are good that
 * all you need to do is {@link require_once} the file that contains the extension.

/** @addtogroup querypath_extensions Extensions
 * The QueryPath extension system and bundled extensions.
 *
 * Much like jQuery, QueryPath provides a simple extension mechanism that allows
 * extensions to auto-register themselves upon being loaded. For a simple example, see
 * QPXML. For the internals, see QueryPath::Extension and QueryPath::with().

/**
 * A Extension is a tool that extends the capabilities of a Query object.
 *
 * Extensions to QueryPath should implement the Extension interface. The
 * only requirement is that the extension provide a constructor that takes a
 * Query object as a parameter.
 *
 * Here is an example QueryPath extension:
 * @code
 * <?php
 * class StubExtensionOne implements \QueryPath\Extension {
 *   private $qp = NULL;
 *   public function __construct(\QueryPath\Query $qp) {
 *     $this->qp = $qp;
 *   }
 *
 *   public function stubToe() {
 *     $this->qp->find(':root')->append('<toe/>')->end();
 *     return $this->qp;
 *   }
 * }
 * ?>
 * @endcode
 * In this example, the StubExtensionOne class implements Extension.
 * The constructor stores a local copyof the Query object. This is important
 * if you are planning on fully integrating with QueryPath's Fluent Interface.
 *
 * Finally, the stubToe() function illustrates how the extension makes use of
 * QueryPath's Query object internally, and remains part of the fluent interface by returning
 * the $qp object.
 *
 * <b>Enabling an Extension</b>
 *
 * To enable an extension, call the QueryPath::enable() method.
 *
 * @code
 * <?php
 * QueryPath::enable('StubExtension');
 * ?>
 * @endcode
 *
 * More complex management of extensions can be accomplished with the
 * QueryPath::ExtensionRegistry class.
 *
 * <b>How is a QueryPath extension called?</b>
 *
 * QueryPath extensions are called like regular QueryPath functions. For
 * example, the extension above can be called like this:
 * <code>
 * qp3('some.xml')->stubToe();
 * // or
 * QueryPath::with('some.xml')->stubToe();
 * </code>
 * Since it returns the Query ($qp) object, chaining is supported:
 * <code>
 * print qp3('some.xml')->stubToe()->xml();
 * </code>
 * When you write your own extensions, anything that does not need to return a
 * specific value should return the Query object. Between that and the
 * extension registry, this will provide the best developer experience.
