 <notes>
   QueryPath 2.0 introduces several new (minor) features. With a reworked
   internal storage model, it should perform significantly faster than its 
   precursor. Many bugs, mostly minor, have been fixed since QueryPath 1.2.
   
   QueryPath 2.0 offers many new features, as well as numerous bug fixes and
   overall performance improvement. Major features:

   * New functions, including textImplode().
   * New arguments to existing functions, such as xml() and branch().
   * A new QueryPathOptions configuration object, which allows request-wide
     configuration.
   * QueryPath now supports many more options, making it more configurable.
   * The re-factoring of QueryPath.php to improve performance.
   * The removal of the QueryPath interface, and the renaming of QueryPathImpl
     to QueryPath. (No public-facing changes.)
   * Better handling of broken HTML/XML entities
   * Overall improvement on error handling. QueryPath now consistently throws
     exceptions. It no longer generates errors.
   * Improved performance. Internal data structures have been rewritten for 
     optimization. Even instances on an opcode cache should see performance 
     improvements.
   * Numerous bugs fixed.
   * Unused protected and private methods have been removed.
   * Unit testing has been bumped up to provide 100% function coverage and
     90%+ line coverage.
